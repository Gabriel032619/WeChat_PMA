# Introduction
This project uses WeChat applet development tools to complete a personnel management applet developed in conjunction with WeChat Cloud.

For privacy reasons, we deleted the cloud function folder.

This project implements the hierarchical permissions for ordinary users and managers. Administrators can edit the main interface announcements, pictures, and course information of the current person. At the same time, you can scan the code to record class information. In addition, it supports user-defined nicknames and avatars.
